# TransperentFox
A transparent firefox skin. This skin has only been tested on Windows, but it may also work on Linux and Mac OS. I hope to test this on Linux in the future.

**Update:** I have now tested this on Linux, specifically on Ubuntu with i3-radius and picom for blur, and it looks *amazing*. I might release a version that is more optomized for blur in the future, once I have a few visual bugs fixed.
